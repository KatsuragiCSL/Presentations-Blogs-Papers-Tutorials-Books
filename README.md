# Presentations-Blogs-Papers-Tutorials-Books
This is a place to share the presentations, blog posts, papers, tutorials, books etc. I have watched/ planed to watch, mainly related to hacking, coding & learning, sometimes just some insightful content that I think they would nurture everyone's mind. Pretty much like a personal book catalog but not only for books.
